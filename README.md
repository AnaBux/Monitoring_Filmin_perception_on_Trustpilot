**Filmin Review Analyzer: Sentiment and Topic Modeling with Gradio**

This project provides an end-to-end workflow for analyzing user reviews from the Filmin platform using NLP techniques. It covers data preprocessing, sentiment analysis, topic modeling with BERTopic, and interactive web demos built with Gradio.


**Features**

- **Review Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and standardizes raw review text for effective NLP processing.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Uses transformer-based models to classify the sentiment of each review.
- **Topic Modeling:** Applies BERTopic to discover and interpret the main topics discussed in the reviews.
- **Visual Analytics:** Generates sentiment distribution charts and word clouds for positive and negative reviews.
- **Interactive Demos:** Gradio-powered web applications for real-time review sentiment and topic analysis, accessible and shareable via a simple web interface.


**Usage**

- **Sentiment & Topic Visualization:** Explore review data trends using distribution charts, topic frequency summaries, and word clouds.
- **Interactive Apps:** Paste any Filmin review into the Gradio demos to instantly receive sentiment prediction and main topics.


**Models & Libraries Used**

- Transformers (e.g., DistilBERT, BERT) for sentiment analysis
- BERTopic for advanced topic modeling
- Gradio for building interactive web interfaces
- Standard Python libraries: pandas, matplotlib, wordcloud, etc.
